To work this script, copy and paste it into a compiler and compile it. Once it's compiled, run it. In order to take advantage of the VMM, use the command access_memory followed by the number of the process you want to allocate a page number for. Use the show_memory command to display current state of physical memory and page tables, and finally use free_memory followed by the the number of the process you want to free from a specific frame.
