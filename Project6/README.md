To work this script, copy and paste it into a compiler and compile it. Once it's compiled, run it. In order to take advantage of the file management system, use the new commands to manage new files/directories. mkdir / (dir_name) will create a new directory, touch / (file_name (bytes)) will create a new file with a certain number of bytes, ls / will show the details of the directory and the files within the directory, rm / (file_name) will remove the given file, and rmdir / (dir_name) will delete the given directory. Some more commands include mv / (dir_name) (new_dir_name) to rename a directory, edit / (dir_name) (file_name) (content) to edit a file, mvfile / (dir_name) (file_name) / (other_dir) to move a file, cpfile / (dir_name) (file_name) (file_name_copy) to duplicate a file, fileinfo / (file_name) to get file info, dirinfo / (dir_name) to get direcotry info. When finished, type 'quit' to exit the shell.
