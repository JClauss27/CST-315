In order to run this script, copy and paste the code into a c file. Then, compile the c file. From there, run the c file through the terminal with no arguments in order to run the input mode. From there, input a command you want the shell to execute. If you want the shell to execute multiple commands at the same time, write multiple commands, seperating each one with a semicolon and a space. Enter "quit" to stop the shell. To run the shell in batch mode, run the c file with the argument of the name of the batch file you want it to run. It will then list each command it is executing followed by its execution. It will automatically quit once it is done executing the commands in the file.
