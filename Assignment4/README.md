To run the virus file, copy the code and paste it into a compiler. Once it is compiled, run it. It will prompt you to insert a command, insert the command 'rm (filename)' to remove a file. This will cause the virus to start, and it will remove the incorrect file. The program will end once you enter the command. The same process goes for the detector program, except once you run it, it will automatically detect corrupted files and tell you which programs are corrupted.
